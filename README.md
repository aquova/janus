# Janus

Discord bot to help generate local timestamps

https://github.com/aquova/janus

## Intro

Discord has added a feature where correctly formatted timestamps will be shown to all users in their own local timezones. It is not trivial to generate these timestamps however, so this bot adds a `/timestamp` slash command which will ask a user for the date, time, and their own timezone for conversion. It will then provide several formatted strings which can be copied and pasted.
